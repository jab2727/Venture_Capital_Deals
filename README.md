Venture_Capital_Deals
=====================

This project does a few things:
1.  Website scraper - It compiles a list of pages at the CNN Venture Capital Deals blog with relevant
    information and then scrapes them to identify the name of the venture stage company, the round that was raised,
    how much  money was raised, and what VC/angels were involved.
2.  .graphml file complier - It then takes this information and complies it into a file that can be read and
    analyzed in Gephi, a free tool I ofund for analysing networks.
3.  Gephi analysis - I've included my Gephi analysis files in the folder and I'll probably keep them updated,
    but really the fun part is running the program yourself and seeing the network take shape.
    
This is my first programming project:
I recently completed the Codecademy class on Python, this is the first code I've written in any language.  The code
works as written, but there are a lot of improvements I'm still making to get the thing to extract more and better
information.  For me, this is at least part of the fun.  But I'm sure I've also violated a number of best-practices,
so if you'd like to help me be a better programmer, help is much appreciated.
